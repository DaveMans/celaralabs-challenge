The `WordFinder` class searches for words from a list in a character matrix, locating them either horizontally or vertically. It:

- Initializes with a matrix of characters.
- Uses the `Find` method to check if words from the input list appear in the matrix.
- Counts and returns the top 10 most frequent words found.

This approach is optimized for performance, ensuring fast and efficient word searching.
